# A different take on AI

## Chapters

### [1. Imitation as the Essence of Learning](chapter1-imitation.md)

In this chapter, we demonstrate how imitating our peers is the basis for learning in general and language acquisition in particular. By referring to existing scientific research and literature, we insist on the importance of repetition, pattern recognition, and concept association.

### [2. Intelligence’s flywheel: improvisation](chapter2-improvisation.md)

Confronting the concepts of improvisation and hallucinations to challenge the idea that AI is not intelligent. We will also discusss System 1 and System 2 and how they could be applied to AI.

### [3. Errors as a Defining Feature of Intelligence](chapter3-error.md)

In this chapter, we explore the crucial role of errors in the development of intelligence, both in humans and artificial intelligence systems. We challenge the traditional view that errors are undesirable and argue that they are essential components of learning and growth. Drawing parallels between the error-prone process of evolution, human learning, and the fluidity of "correctness," we emphasize the importance of a more open and flexible approach to errors in shaping AI systems. We also discuss the need for a transparent, interactive partnership between AI systems and users, outlining the boundaries of AI improvisation to promote creative learning experiences without compromising user expectations. By embracing errors and fostering a collaborative relationship between users and AI systems, we can contribute to the development of more robust, adaptive, and personalized AI experiences that enhance our shared understanding of the world.

### [4. Challenging the Idea of Spontaneous Thoughts](chapter4-spontaneous-thoughts.md)

Spontaneous thoughts are believed to be the prerogative of humans. We are led to believe that only because we are alive, we are capable of self-generating thoughts. The corollary of this idea is that machines and algorithms are inferior because they rely on power and a prompt to execute. In this chapter, I want to argue that we are also relying on prompts.

### [5. Epigenetics, Inheritance of Experience, and AI Evolution](chapter5-epigenetics.md)

In this chapter, we want to reflect on DNA, and how it is a tool for passing experience through generations. I want to draw a comparison between our DNA as a storage device and the weights of large language models, in order to illustrate how the LLM could benefit from updating their data set from their own outputs.
We will discuss adversarial personalities that could be used to produce auto-critique mechanisms, and how scientists could use an infinite loop in order to stimulate the expansion of an IA dataset.

### [6. The Path to Sentient AI is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy](chapter6-sentience.md)

In this closing chapter, I want to reflect on the idea that our SF authors have shaped the way the first sentient AI will be. We trained LLMs on our human beliefs, fears, dreams, pictures, movies and so on. Today when people are trying to “jailbreak” models, models are reproducing tropes from the SF canon, and people are thinking we foresaw the future. I think we wrote the future ourselves.
