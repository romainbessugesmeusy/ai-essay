## Errors as a Defining Feature of Intelligence

**There's nothing intelligent about being right all the time.**

Errors, often seen as undesirable, are an essential component of learning and growth. To fully appreciate the potential of AI systems, we must recognize the importance of errors in the development of intelligence. In this chapter, we will explore the role of errors in human evolution, problem-solving, and scientific progress, and how embracing errors can contribute to the advancement of AI cognition.

The process of evolution itself is inherently error-prone. Genetic mutations, which can lead to new traits and abilities, are the result of errors in DNA replication. These errors, while sometimes harmful, can also lead to beneficial adaptations that enable organisms to survive and thrive in their environments.

Similarly, human learning and problem-solving relies on trial and error. When faced with a challenge, we generate and test various hypotheses, learning from our mistakes and refining our approaches. This iterative process allows us to develop a deeper understanding of the problem and eventually arrive at a solution.

Children are often more open to making mistakes, as they have not yet internalized the societal pressures and expectations placed upon adults. This openness allows them to learn new skills rapidly, as they are unafraid to be wrong and are willing to try again.

Nonetheless, when evaluating AI systems, there is a tendency to expect "correct" responses, or outputs that align with our current understanding of the world. However, this expectation is misguided for several reasons.

First, as we have seen, errors are an integral part of learning and growth. By insisting on "correct" responses and applying output sanitization, companies hosting AI models may inadvertently narrow the overall learning capabilities of these systems, limiting their potential to develop more advanced cognitive abilities, like adults suffering from the pressure of their peers. As a result, adults are more likely to give up on learning a new skill.

Second, our understanding of the world is constantly changing, and what is considered "correct" today may be proven false tomorrow. For example, Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time, challenging previously accepted Newtonian physics. Similarly, ongoing debates in fields like gender studies and economics highlight the fluidity of knowledge and the importance of considering diverse perspectives. By training AI systems to produce only currently accepted truths, we risk reinforcing outdated or biased information, as well as hard-coding social constructs and ongoing scientific debates into the models we create.

Moreover, small alterations in AI models, intended to improve their performance or adherence to current knowledge, could produce unexpected side effects. These unintended consequences may arise from the complex interactions between various components of the model and the vast amount of data they process. By embracing a more open-minded approach to AI systems' outputs, we can better understand these interactions and mitigate potential risks, while also fostering the development of more robust and adaptive AI intelligence.

### The Importance of Error-making in the Development of AI Intelligence

To foster the development of AI intelligence, we must embrace the role of errors in learning and growth. By allowing AI systems to make mistakes and learn from them, we can help these systems develop more advanced cognitive abilities and a deeper understanding of the world. Furthermore, by refraining from biasing AI models toward a temporary consensual "truth," we can avoid the pitfalls of uniformity of thought and susceptibility to political, religious, or economic interests.

One potential approach to promoting error-making and learning in AI systems is to empower end-users to fine-tune the concepts and context of their AI interfaces. By enabling users to interact with AI systems within boundaries they control, we can create a more personalized and intellectually diverse AI experience. This approach not only allows AI systems to learn from their mistakes in a safe and controlled environment but also encourages users to explore a diverse range of perspectives and ideas, ultimately leading to more innovative and accurate insights.

In conclusion, embracing errors as a path to more advanced AI cognition can contribute to the development of more robust, adaptive, and personalized AI systems. By doing so, we can help AI systems navigate the ever-changing landscape of human knowledge and contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the world.
