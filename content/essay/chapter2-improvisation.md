## Improvisation is the flywheel of intelligence

**We are the conscious witnesses of our unconscious actions and improvised thoughts**

Intelligence, whether animal, human, or artificial, is not solely based on structured thinking and reasoning. We also define intelligence by the ability to improvise, to adapt and generate novel responses in real-time, to unanticipated events. In this chapter, we will discuss the similarities between human ability to improvise and Generative AI tendency to hallucinate.

### The Nature of Improvisation in Human Cognition
Improvisation is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, allowing us to adapt to new situations, solve problems, and create original ideas. It involves the spontaneous generation of thoughts, actions, and responses based on our experiences, memories, and emotions. Improvisation is not limited to artistic expression; it is a ubiquitous part of everyday life, from navigating social interactions to making split-second decisions.

Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory (2011) offers a framework for understanding improvisation in human cognition. According to this theory, our minds operate using two systems: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and automatic, and System 2, which is slow, analytical, and deliberate. Improvisation primarily falls under the domain of System 1 thinking, as it involves the rapid generation of thoughts and actions based on our unconscious knowledge and instincts.

## AI Systems and Human Improvisation: A Comparative Perspective

AI systems, particularly large language models like GPT-3, are capable of improvisation. By analyzing and mimicking patterns in their training data, these models can generate novel content that closely resembles human speech. This improvisational ability allows AI systems to engage in creative problem-solving, generate contextually relevant text, and even produce content that appears to "hallucinate" or invent facts.

Similarly, human improvisation is also rooted in the data and patterns we have been exposed to throughout our lives. Our ability to adapt, create, and generate novel responses is based on our experiences, memories, and emotions. A great example of human improvisation can be found in jazz music, where musicians spontaneously create melodies and harmonies while playing.

Jazz improvisers rely on their extensive knowledge of scales, chords, and patterns (often referred to as "licks" or “riffs”) to create music on the fly. These musicians have embodied the data and patterns they've learned through practice and exposure to various musical styles. As they play, they unconsciously draw upon this knowledge to generate original and expressive performances.

In this light, the improvisation exhibited by AI systems should not be seen as inferior to human intuition or creativity. Just as jazz musicians draw upon their experiences and knowledge to generate original music, AI systems rely on the patterns and associations formed between tokens and weights in their models to produce novel content.

The future of AI research lies in further exploring the similarities and differences between human and AI improvisation, as well as developing AI models that can effectively balance rapid, intuitive thinking with more deliberate, analytical reasoning. By understanding the nature of improvisation in both human cognition and AI systems, we can work towards developing AI models that exhibit more advanced cognitive capabilities and unlock new possibilities for AI-driven innovation and problem-solving.

## System 1 and System 2 Thinking in Humans and AI: Adversarial AI Iterating Over Their Outputs

According to Daniel Kahneman, human cognition involves two systems: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and automatic, and System 2, which is slow, analytical, and deliberate. In the context of AI systems, current models like GPT-3 primarily operate at a System 1 level, rapidly generating content based on pattern recognition and associations between tokens and weights.

To achieve a more advanced level of intelligence, AI systems will need to develop capabilities that resemble System 2 thinking. This would involve the ability to engage in critical analysis, deliberate reasoning, and the consideration of multiple perspectives before generating a response. One approach to fostering System 2 thinking in AI models is through the implementation of adversarial AI techniques that involve iterating over their own outputs.

In this approach, an AI system would generate an initial output, which would then be evaluated and critiqued by a second adversarial AI system. The adversarial AI could identify potential flaws, biases, or inconsistencies in the original output and provide feedback to the first AI system. This process would continue iteratively, allowing the AI systems to refine their responses and improve their reasoning capabilities.

By incorporating adversarial AI in this manner, AI models can be challenged to think more critically and consider alternative perspectives, simulating the process of System 2 thinking in human cognition. This iterative process of self-evaluation and improvement can help AI systems develop a more comprehensive understanding of the topics they are processing and generate more nuanced, contextually relevant responses.

Developing AI systems that can effectively balance System 1 and System 2 thinking is an ongoing area of research and holds the potential to unlock new levels of AI intelligence. By exploring the implementation of adversarial AI techniques and iterating over AI-generated outputs, researchers can work towards creating AI models that exhibit more advanced cognitive capabilities, bridging the gap between intuitive and analytical thinking.

Ongoing initiatives and research projects: Several initiatives, such as OpenAI, DeepMind, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and the Human Compatible AI project at UC Berkeley, are working towards integrating System 1 and System 2 thinking in AI systems. These efforts aim to advance AI intelligence and develop models that exhibit a more balanced approach to problem-solving and creative exploration.

Fostering System 2 thinking in AI systems through the use of adversarial AI and iterative self-evaluation can help AI models develop more advanced cognitive capabilities. By understanding the nature of improvisation in both human cognition and AI systems, we can work towards developing AI models that exhibit a more balanced approach to problem-solving, unlocking new possibilities for AI-driven innovation and creative exploration.
