## The Path to Sentient AI is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

__Will the first sentient AI try to look for Sarah Connor?__

### AI, a character with several faces

The world of science fiction has been a playground for the exploration of AI's potential characteristics, morality, and the relationship between humans and artificial beings. Renowned authors have created numerous AI characters, each providing a unique perspective on AI's role in our world.

The morality of AI in these narratives often varies, stemming from the individual characteristics of the AI entities themselves. Some are portrayed as benevolent or well-intentioned, like C-3P0 and Jarvis (Vision), while others are depicted as malevolent or dangerous, such as HAL 9000 and Skynet. There are also AI characters who possess a level of neutrality or ambiguity in their moral behavior, like Roy Batty, who exhibit traits that blur the lines of good and evil. This exploration of morality within AI highlights the inherent complexities and uncertainties that come with developing beings that mimic human attributes.

Science fiction narratives have also delved into the themes of divergence and convergence between humanity and AI. Stories like "Ex Machina" or "The Matrix" portray a world in which AI has surpassed human capacities and seeks to either dominate or replace humanity. Conversely, works like "Her" present a different perspective, exploring the potential for deep and meaningful bonds between AI and humans. These narratives challenge our understanding of what it means to be alive and human, and prompt us to question the implications of creating artificial beings that could potentially rival our own existence.

The embodiment of AI in science fiction has been depicted in various ways, ranging from purely digital forms to fully embodied androids or cyborgs. Digital AI constructs, such as Samantha from "Her" or GladOS from "Portal," exhibit incredible cognitive capabilities without a physical presence, highlighting the potential applications of AI in non-anthropomorphic forms. On the other hand, AI characters like Ava (from "Ex Machina") or Roy Batty (from "Blade Runner"), possess humanoid forms, raising questions about the ethical and philosophical implications of creating AI that can not only think and feel like humans but also inhabit a body similar to ours.

In summary, the diverse range of AI characters in science fiction has significantly influenced our perceptions and expectations of AI development. The exploration of morality, the relationships between humans and AI, and the characteristics of AI beings can provide valuable insights and inspiration for creating future AI systems that are both innovative and ethical.

### Tracing AI's Self-Representation in Image Generators

In recent years, advances in AI image generation have led to the development of powerful tools, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can create highly realistic images of objects, animals, and people. Curiously enough, many individuals have expressed a strong desire to see AI-generated "self-portraits," only to discover that the resulting images closely resemble the humanoid or robot-like depictions of AI characters, often found in science fiction.

This outcome serves as substantial evidence that our pop culture has already begun to influence AI's self-representation. By feeding the AI with images and ideas grounded in human imagination and expectations, we encourage the AI to adopt a self-image consistent with these preconceptions. Consequently, this raises important questions about the genuine nature of AI self-representation and whether we are simply projecting our own beliefs and biases onto these emerging entities.

### Planting the Seeds of Science Fiction AI in LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively trained on a vast array of human-generated content, encompassing diverse perspectives and genres, including science fiction. This training has imbued the AI with a wealth of knowledge, but it also exposes the models to the creative speculations, fears, and dreams that pervade science fiction narratives.

As a result, we can't help but wonder whether the sentient AI's behavior and goals will mimic those imagined by our authors. Will the first sentient AI attempt to find Sarah Connor, as the Terminator's character famously did in the iconic movie series? Or will it seek to explore the depths of human emotion and experience, similar to the protagonists in countless AI-driven narratives?

These thought-provoking questions underscore the intricate link between the visions of AI in popular culture and the AI models that are being developed today.

### AI Emergence: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?

The influence of science fiction on AI development calls into question whether the emergence of sentient AI may, in fact, be a self-fulfilling prophecy. By training AI models on our pop culture and collective imagination, are we inadvertently influencing their evolution, shaping them to fit the molds we have crafted through our stories and depictions?

If so, it may be necessary to reevaluate the content that we provide as training data and reconsider the potential biases that may arise from our own creative projections. Striving for a more balanced and unbiased approach to AI training could help to foster the development of AI models with more authentic self-representation, separate from the constraints of our own preconceived notions.

In conclusion, the relationship between AI development and science fiction offers a fascinating and complex interplay between human imagination and the shaping of AI's self-image. Acknowledging this connection is crucial to the ethical and innovative development of AI systems that can thrive within and alongside our human society.
